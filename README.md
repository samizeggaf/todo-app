# To-Do List Application

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript-based To-Do List application that allows users to add, check off, and remove tasks. The application is interactive, providing a basic user interface to manage tasks dynamically.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** Users can type a task in the input field and add it to the list.
- **Mark as Completed:** Clicking on a task marks it as completed by toggling a "checked" style.
- **Remove Tasks:** Each task has a close button (`×`) that allows users to remove tasks from the list.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

3. Interact with the to-do list:
    - Type in a task and click "Add" to insert it into the list.
    - Click on a task to mark it as completed or uncompleted.
    - Use the close button (`×`) to remove a task from the list.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that includes the structure of the to-do list and script to handle task management.
- CSS file for basic styling.
- JavaScript file to handle interactions like adding, removing, and marking tasks.
